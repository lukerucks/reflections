What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, you add a .git folder which contains metadata keeping track of commits.  It needs to be done because every folder is not a git repository by default.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area has only some of the files from the working directory; it affects what will be commited.  I'm still unsure if a commit consists entirely of what is in the staging area, or if it works on the whole working directory.  

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area allow you to commit changes to the exact files needed to make one logical change.  It's manual nature reinforces your decision to commit, along with what to commit.
