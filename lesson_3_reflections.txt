When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are collaborating with other people, or are using a public computer, or generally don't trust your hard drive, it can be usefule to use a remote repository.  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are working on something simultaneously with someone else, whoever didn't finish first might lose their work or otherwise make unintended changes if it was done automatically.
